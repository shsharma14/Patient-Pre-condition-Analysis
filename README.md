# Patient-Pre-condition-Analysis

My main objective was to analyze the factors that influence mortality in patients who do not need an intensive care unit and those who do. What are the underlying comorbidities that patients are likely to test positive for COVID? Which factors influence the need for an intensive care unit? This can help with patient triage, optimal distribution of vaccinations (if needed) in countries with limited resources, or prevention in countries susceptible to the virus.

I had data of 566k patients related to their health conditions such as whether they have pneumonia, cardiovascular problems, obesity, copd, asthma etc.

After data cleaning and feature engineering, I compared the results of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees to classify ICU requirements, likelihood of testing positive and factors that affect fatality rate.
